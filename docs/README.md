A practical introduction to git
===============================

This course aims to take a new user from the basics of version control to intermediate usage over 82 slides. Most information slides are followed immediately by an exercise slide, so this is very much a hands on course. 

The course is hosted at http://annaken.github.io/intro_to_git_course
